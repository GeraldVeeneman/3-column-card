### Useful resources

- [W3Schools CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - This helped me to understand how to use CSS Flexbox. I really like this site and will use it going forward.
- [W3Schools CSS Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp)
 This helped me to understand how to use CSS Variables. During this project I defined the different used colours using CSS variables. 
- [Sanitize.css](https://github.com/csstools/sanitize.css/) - a CSS library that provides consistent, cross-browser default styling of HTML elements alongside useful defaults.
It is developed alongside normalize.css, which means every normalization is included, and every normalization and opinion are clearly marked and documented.
